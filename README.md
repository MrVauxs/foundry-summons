An all-in-one solution to all your summoning needs with NO need to import Actors to place them on the map!

Easily expandable with Hooks, and system-inclusive. Should work on any system.
Just grab the **macro** from the compendium and start summoning!

### **If you want more information, see the [wiki](https://github.com/MrVauxs/foundry-summons/wiki/Macro-Arguments)!**

Built in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using [TyphonJS Framework](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-lib) for Foundry.
